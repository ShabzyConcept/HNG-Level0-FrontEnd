          <h2>My Bio</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm a passionate frontend developer embarking on an exciting
            journey to master modern web development. My fascination with
            creating beautiful, accessible, and functional web experiences
            drives me to learn and grow every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that great web development combines technical excellence
            with user-centered design. Every line of code I write is an
            opportunity to make the web more inclusive and accessible for
            everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring blockchain Technologies and
            Vibe code some of my blockchain idea into reality.

            <p>
              Remember where you started. Remember the excitement of writing
              your first responsive layout, the frustration of debugging that

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
          <h2>Additional Thoughts & Reflections</h2>

          <h3>Why I Chose Frontend Development</h3>
          <p>
            Frontend development perfectly combines my love for problem-solving
            with creative expression. There's something magical about
            transforming ideas into interactive experiences that people can see,
            touch, and use. Every website is a blank canvas with infinite
            possibilities.
          </p>

          <h3>My Learning Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            I believe in learning by doing. Theory is important, but nothing
            beats getting your hands dirty with real projects. I'm committed to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Building projects that challenge me beyond my comfort zone</li>
            <li>
              Reading documentation thoroughly instead of always reaching for
              tutorials
            </li>
            <li>
              Asking questions when stuck, but trying to solve problems
              independently first
            </li>
            <li>Contributing to the community by sharing what I learn</li>
            <li>Embracing failure as a teacher, not an enemy</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Technologies I'm Excited About</h3>
          <p>
            The frontend ecosystem is vast and ever-changing. Here are some
            areas that particularly excite me:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Accessibility (a11y):</strong> Making the web usable
              for everyone
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Progressive Web Apps:</strong> Bridging the gap between
              web and native apps
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CSS Grid & Flexbox:</strong> Modern layout systems that
              make design easier
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaScript ES6+:</strong> Modern syntax and features that
              improve code quality
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Performance:</strong> Optimizing for speed and
              efficiency
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Beyond Code</h3>
          <p>
            I understand that being a great developer isn't just about technical
            skills. Soft skills matter too. I'm working on improving my
            communication, collaboration, and problem-solving abilities. I want
            to be someone who not only writes great code but also works well in
            teams and helps others grow.
          </p>

          <div class="highlight">

              <em>
                "The best way to predict the future is to create it." - Peter

            </p>
            <p>
              This quote resonates with me because as frontend developers, we
              literally create the interfaces that shape how people interact
              with technology. That's a responsibility I take seriously and a
              privilege I'm grateful for.
